# Blog-Post
This project is a simple blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts within a single session.  Posts are stored in memory, meaning they do not persist after the server restarts. The focus of this project is on understanding server-side rendering.
